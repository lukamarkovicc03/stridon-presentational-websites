/**
 * The backend's own `[Required]` declarations, checked against what it really sends.
 *
 * This started life checking our hand-written interfaces against real responses,
 * because `Tag.imageUrl` was declared `string` here while
 * `StorefrontTagDTO.ImageUrl` had been `string?` on the backend forever. That
 * class of bug is now gone by construction: the types are ALIASED from the
 * generated schema (`packages/shared/src/types/*.ts`), so a transcription error
 * is unrepresentable rather than merely detectable.
 *
 * What generation cannot prove is that the backend obeys its own contract. A DTO
 * marked `[Required] public string ImageUrl` whose projection LEFT JOINs and
 * sends null type-checks perfectly on both sides of the wire and still hands
 * `null` to code the schema promised would never see one. That is what this
 * still checks, and it is the only remaining shape guard worth running.
 *
 * The sibling ledger (api-contract-coverage.test.ts) protects the ROUTES; these
 * calls double as its coverage, which is why five endpoints left its debt list.
 *
 * KNOWN LIMIT: a response can only catch a violation once some row exhibits it.
 * It cannot prove a field is never null. Generation covers the declared
 * contract; this covers the delivered data; neither alone is complete.
 *
 * Scope: top-level fields. Nested shapes (ProductMedia, CategoryBreadcrumb) are
 * the obvious extension, left out to keep the first version readable.
