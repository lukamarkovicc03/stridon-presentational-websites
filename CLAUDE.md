## Critical principles

- **Push back on hacks.** If a request leads to a fragile workaround, say so and propose the clean solution. Never silently accept shortcuts.
- **Be critical of every decision** - naming, architecture, data flow, UX. Question whether the approach would hold up at the scale and quality bar of Shopify, Magento, IKEA, Temu, AliExpress, or Alibaba.
- **Consult official docs when unsure.** Frameworks change fast. When writing Next.js code, verify APIs and patterns against the [Next.js docs](https://nextjs.org/docs) using WebFetch - don't rely solely on training data, which may be outdated.
- **Only commit current-session changes.** When committing, only stage files changed during this session - do not commit pre-existing uncommitted changes from the working tree.

## Project Overview

**Company**: Stridon Group DOO (stridon.rs) - a tool company with an online shop at prodavnicaalata.rs.

**This repo**: Turborepo monorepo with three websites sharing components and utilities (Next.js 16, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS v4, Vercel):

| Project  | Directory        | Domain       | Theme      | Brand slug |
| -------- | ---------------- | ------------ | ---------- | ---------- |
| SG TOOLS | `apps/sg-tools/` | sgtools.rs   | Dark only  | `sg-tools` |
| DCK      | `apps/dck/`      | dcksrbija.rs | Light only | `dck`      |
| Stridon  | `apps/stridon/`  | stridon.rs   | Light only | `stridon`  |

**Purpose**: Display brand products (fetched server-side from the main platform's REST API), these sites are display-only - no cart or checkout, the core of the websites is to interest and enable dealers to sell our brands, not to push buying from prodavnicaalata.rs.

**Brand voice**: Friendly and approachable. Serbian copy uses informal "ti" form (not "Vi") - keep it casual and direct.

## Critical Rules

- **Serbian tone**: Always use informal "ti" form in Serbian copy - never formal "Vi". Keep it casual and friendly.
- **Serbian URLs**: All routes use Serbian path names (e.g., `/o-nama`, `/kontakt`, `/proizvodi/kategorije`).
- For minor straightforward changes, we don't need to build at all.
- **Type-check command**: `pnpm -C apps/dck exec tsc --noEmit` (or `apps/sg-tools`, `apps/stridon`). Do NOT use `npx tsc` - it won't resolve workspace dependencies.

## Environment Variables

- Use `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix for client-accessible vars
- Use `.env.local` in each app directory for local development secrets (gitignored)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_BRAND_SLUG` - Set in `next.config.ts` per app (`"sg-tools"` or `"dck"`)
- Key variables (same for both):
  - `API_URL` - Base URL for the PACMS backend REST API (server-only)
  - `BREVO_API_KEY` - Brevo email service API key (contact form)
  - `PACMS_RATELIMIT_BYPASS_SECRET` - Shared secret sent as the `X-Internal-Bypass` header on every `apiFetch` call; the Cloudflare edge fronting `api.pacms.in.rs` validates + strips it and injects the trusted rate-limit marker, so SSG build reads aren't throttled as anonymous. Optional (absent ⇒ anonymous). Set in each app's Vercel project; same value as the CMS `TF_VAR_storefront_ratelimit_bypass_secret`. See the PACMS repo `docs/trusted-first-party-caller.md`. **Also put it in each app's `.env.local`, or local builds break in a way that reads like a code bug.** `generateStaticParams` here returns the *complete* catalog (315 products / 91 categories on sg-tools, 139 / 64 on dck), so one `next build` is hundreds of anonymous reads against the production API — enough that the *next* build 429s mid-prerender and fails with an `ApiError` stack pointing at `api.ts`. Cost us a build on 2026-08-03. **The secret being set is not sufficient locally: a bare `pnpm build` runs both apps concurrently and still 429s** (observed 2026-08-05, both `.env.local`s populated) — and the retry inside the rate-limit window fails again, the second time as an opaque `Failed to collect page data` with the status swallowed, which reads even more like a code bug. Verify with `pnpm turbo build --filter=<app>` one app at a time.

## Tests

Two lanes, and only two — `pnpm test` (hermetic) and `pnpm test:integration` (live).

- **`pnpm test`** — everything except `*.integration.test.ts`. No network, no secrets; it is the command everyone types, so it must stay runnable on a plane. The exclusion sits in each workspace's `test` / `test:watch` script rather than in `vitest.config.ts`, because a config-level `exclude` also hides those files from dck's `vitest run integration.test` filter, leaving the live lane selecting nothing. Every workspace carries it, including the ones with no integration test yet — that is what makes a newly added one land outside this lane by default.
- **`pnpm test:integration`** — dck only; real HTTP against the production PACMS backend.

**Never fold the integration tests back into `test`, and never add `PACMS_API_KEY` to `apps/dck/.env.local` to "fix" a red run.** `warranty-registration.integration.test.ts` POSTs *real* warranty registrations; with the key present, every `pnpm test` — and every save under `test:watch` — writes rows to production. Until 2026-08-03 the root `test` lane did exactly this and was permanently red for anyone without the key, which is the only reason nobody had the key.

Both halves are enforced rather than merely documented, by `apps/dck/__tests__/test-lane-wiring.test.ts`: it fails if a workspace runs vitest without the exclusion, and if a package holds an integration test but defines no `test:integration` script. The second case is the quiet one — turbo resolves a task a package doesn't define to `<NONEXISTENT>` and skips it without error, so that test runs in no lane at all while still counting as coverage in `api-contract-coverage.test.ts`.

The integration tests **throw** rather than `skipIf` when `PACMS_API_KEY` is missing. That is deliberate: a skip makes the CI job green when the secret is missing or rotated (see `apps/dck/__tests__/api-contract-coverage.test.ts` for the outage this suite exists to catch).

## Preflight — the same checks run locally and in CI

`pnpm preflight` = `turbo lint test`, ~6s cold. `.githooks/pre-push` runs it on every push, and the root `prepare` script arms the hook (`git config core.hooksPath .githooks`) on `pnpm install`. `core.hooksPath` is local config that does not travel with a clone, so a hook nobody installed is a file rather than a gate; hanging it off the one step you cannot skip removes that failure mode. Bypass a known-safe push with `git push --no-verify`. pa-storefront could adopt the same one-liner (it has a root `package.json` and still uses a manual `scripts/setup-hooks.sh`); **pa-cms genuinely cannot** — no root node install, so a .NET-only contributor would never run it.

The hook must never run `test:integration` (see above — it writes to production). It is also not the enforcement point: `test.yml` runs `lint` and `unit` as **parallel** jobs, because a hook is one `--no-verify` away from silence, and because turbo halts `preflight` on the first failing task — folded into one job, a lint error would hide the test result. Lint ran nowhere in CI until 2026-08-04, and both apps now lint with `--max-warnings=0`; without it the warning tier is decorative, which is how `ComboboxChipsInput` sat destructuring `children` and dropping it. **Known gap:** `turbo lint` only reaches the two apps — `packages/{shared,ui,brand-config}` define no `lint` script, so the shared code both apps depend on is still unlinted. Closing it means an eslint config per package (or a shared `@brand/eslint-config`, the shape pa-storefront uses).

```

### Package Responsibilities

**`@brand/config`** (`packages/brand-config/`): Brand configuration contract. Call `getBrandConfig()` to get brand-specific values (logo, URLs, colors, email config, etc.) resolved via `NEXT_PUBLIC_BRAND_SLUG`.

**`@brand/ui`** (`packages/ui/`): All shadcn/ui primitives (button, input, accordion, etc.). Self-contained with its own `cn()` utility. Brand-agnostic - uses CSS custom properties that resolve per-app theme.

**`@brand/shared`** (`packages/shared/`): All shared components (~50), utilities (`api.ts`, `utils.ts`, `categories.ts`, `geo.ts`, `metadata.ts`), types, hooks, schemas, OG image utilities, and base CSS.

### App Shell Contents (what stays per-app)

Each app (`apps/sg-tools/`, `apps/dck/`) contains only:

- `app/globals.css` - Theme OKLCH tokens (dark vs light)
- `app/layout.tsx` - Viewport, structured data, body class
- `app/page.tsx` - Homepage composition
- `app/**/page.tsx` - Route pages (thin, compose shared components)
- `app/api/og/route.tsx` - Brand-specific on-demand OG image route (query-param driven; wired via `buildOgImageUrl` in shared `metadata.ts`)
- `app/kontakt/actions.ts` - Email sender config (uses `getBrandConfig()`)
- `components/hero.tsx` - Brand-specific hero (SG has decorations/badges, DCK has dashboard)
- `constants/` - Brand-specific content strings, links, dealers
- `lib/og/` - Brand-specific OG templates, logo SVG, color constants
- `public/` - Brand-specific assets (logos, images)

DCK additionally has: `app/produzetak-garancije/`, `components/warranty/`, `lib/schemas/warranty.ts`

### Brand Config Injection

Three patterns for consuming brand-specific values in shared code:

| Pattern               | When                                     | Example                                            |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `getBrandConfig()`    | Server components needing brand identity | `footer.tsx` reads logo, `api.ts` reads brandSlug  |
| Props from app pages  | Content arrays that vary per brand       | `<Stats stats={STATS} />` from app's `constants/`  |
| CSS custom properties | Theming (colors)                         | `bg-primary` resolves via each app's `globals.css` |

### Import Aliases

| Alias             | Resolves to                                               |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `@/*`             | App root (e.g., `@/constants/links`, `@/components/hero`) |
| `@brand/config`   | `packages/brand-config/src/`                              |
| `@brand/ui/*`     | `packages/ui/src/*`                                       |
| `@brand/shared/*` | `packages/shared/src/*`                                   |

### Route Structure (both apps)

| Route                              | URL                            |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `app/page.tsx`                     | `/`                            |
| `app/o-nama/`                      | `/o-nama`                      |
| `app/kontakt/`                     | `/kontakt`                     |
| `app/gde-kupiti/`                  | `/gde-kupiti`                  |
| `app/proizvodi/kategorije/`        | `/proizvodi/kategorije`        |
| `app/proizvodi/kategorije/[slug]/` | `/proizvodi/kategorije/[slug]` |
| `app/proizvodi/[slug]/`            | `/proizvodi/[slug]`            |

DCK also has: `app/produzetak-garancije/` → `/produzetak-garancije` (with 308 redirect from the old `/registracija-garancije` URL)

### Key Patterns

**Server vs Client components**: Most section components are plain server components. Client components (`"use client"`) are used only where interactivity is needed: Navbar, MobileMenu, Container (Framer Motion animations), WhereToBuyContent, DealerList, WarrantyForm.

**Dynamic IO under `cacheComponents: true`** (set in both `apps/*/next.config.ts`): zero-arg dynamic APIs — `new Date()`, `Date.now()`, `Math.random()`, `cookies()`, `headers()` — fail static prerender if called during render, including inside `"use client"` components. Acceptable patterns:

- **Client components**: defer the call to an event handler (e.g., `Popover.onOpenChange` in `apps/dck/components/warranty/warranty-form.tsx`) or to `useSyncExternalStore`. Do NOT use `useEffect` + `setState` — React 19 flags it as cascading renders. Lazy `useState(() => new Date())` also fails because the initializer runs during the first render.
- **Server components**: wrap dynamic subtrees in `<Suspense>` or use `"use cache"`.

**OpenGraph images**: served on demand from a single per-app route handler (`app/api/og/route.tsx`) that reads title/type/image from query params — not the per-route `opengraph-image.tsx` file convention (removed; it prerendered one image per entity at build, fanning out backend fetches until they timed out). Pages declare their OG URL via the metadata helpers (`buildOgImageUrl` in `metadata.ts`). Product images are passed as raw URLs from trusted hosts (R2 + the legacy `media.prodavnicaalata.rs`, enforced by `isTrustedImageUrl`); satori fetches them at request time and the result is CDN-cached for a year.

**Layout wrapper components** (in `@brand/shared`):

- `Wrapper` - Max-width container (`lg:max-w-7xl`) with responsive padding
- `Container` - Framer Motion animation wrapper with preset animations

**Serbian content**:

- All Serbian strings are hardcoded directly - no i18n framework
- Structured data arrays live in per-app `constants/content.ts`
- Navigation labels in per-app `constants/links.ts`

## PACMS Backend Dependency

This repo depends on the **PACMS** platform (`c:\Users\user\Documents\Projects\PACMS`) for several backend services:

**Product data**: `API_URL` points to the PACMS backend (`/api/Storefront/*` endpoints). All product, category, and sitemap data is fetched from there via `packages/shared/src/lib/api.ts`.

Every read is bounded by `packages/shared/src/lib/request-budget.ts`, and `apiFetch` takes the tier as a **required** argument so a new fetcher can't inherit a silent default: `critical` (4s) for the entity a route is *about* (product/category/tag by slug — its absence means the page can't render), `auxiliary` (2.5s) for everything else, which degrades into its `SectionErrorBoundary` instead of hanging the page. Build and dev serve lift to 60s; that lift is not optional, since a build prerenders the whole catalog against a possibly-cold backend. Two rules when touching this: the `try/catch` around `fetch` must keep reporting aborts (a timeout produces no `Response`, so the `!res.ok` branch can never see it — without the catch, a stalled backend degrades a section with *nothing* in Sentry), and an availability failure must never become `null` (only a resolved 404 may), or a timeout caches a healthy URL as gone and invites Google to deindex it. Both pinned by `packages/shared/__tests__/api-availability.test.ts`.

**A missing PACMS image is `null`, and the absent branch renders `<ImagePlaceholder>`** (`@brand/ui/image-placeholder`) — never a URL, never an empty box. PACMS deleted its stored `default.jpg` sentinel in August 2026 (pa-cms `cc00612c`; rationale in that repo's `Backend/CLAUDE.md` → "Image absence is null, never a placeholder row"), so `imageUrl` really is null now and the `&&` guards written for it were leaving blank tiles. Users: `product-card`, `category-card`, and both sites in dck's `product-autocomplete` (the 64px selected-product preview and the 40px combobox row — fixed-size, so they size via `className` rather than `fill`). Two deliberate non-users, don't "finish the job":

- **`tag-card`** fills with `tag.color`, which is non-nullable on `StorefrontTagDTO` — a designed campaign tile carrying the tag's own data, not missing photography.
- **`product-gallery`** keeps a visible „Nema slike" label: a gallery has no adjacent link text naming the product, so a silent grey frame reads as a failed load. Same exception pa-storefront's PDP gallery makes.

**Of the 16 `next/image` files, 8 render remote PACMS URLs and 8 render local assets — do not reach for "most of them are local", which is how the autocomplete pair got missed on the first pass.** The remote 8: the six named above (`product-card`, `category-card`, `tag-card`, `product-gallery`, `product-autocomplete`, plus `catalog-card`) and two that need no guard for a checked reason — `media-lightbox` renders `item.url` from a list that cannot contain a null, and the tag page's `bannerMediaUrl` is guarded at block level, where absence correctly means no banner section at all. `catalog-card` is unguarded because `previewImageUrl` is `[Required]` on `StorefrontCatalogDTO` and catalogs are admin-uploaded, never synced.

**Nothing mechanically enforces any of this, and the two obvious guards are both wrong here.** A shared `Image` wrapper is what pa-storefront uses, but its wrapper exists primarily for `overrideSrc` (pinning the raw media URL as the crawler-visible `src`, a channel worth ~14.7% of its organic clicks) and it couples image-presence to an eager-loading budget — the null branch there is a *rider* on a wrapper that had to exist anyway. This repo has zero `overrideSrc` usages and no such budget, so a wrapper here would carry one job that TypeScript already forces at every nullable site. A `no-restricted-imports` lint ban is blocked for a different reason: `turbo lint` only reaches the two apps (see Preflight above — `packages/{shared,ui,brand-config}` define no `lint` script), so a ban would cover 2 of the 8 remote sites and miss the six in `packages/shared` where the cards actually live. Standing up per-package eslint is the prerequisite for ever revisiting it. Until then: check the field's nullability in `packages/shared/src/types/api.ts` and branch.

**Error reporting**: Errors are captured by `@sentry/nextjs` and sent to Sentry (email alerts configured per-project). Implementation:

- `apps/*/instrumentation.ts` - `onRequestError` via `Sentry.captureRequestError`
- `packages/shared/src/lib/report-error.ts` - `reportError()` via `Sentry.captureException` for explicitly-caught errors

**Warranty extension** (DCK only, user-facing name "Produžetak garancije"): `apps/dck/app/produzetak-garancije/actions.ts` submits warranty forms to `/api/Storefront/SubmitWarrantyRegistration` (authenticated via `PACMS_API_KEY` / `X-Api-Key` header). Backend endpoint name remains `SubmitWarrantyRegistration` — internal identifiers (`submitWarrantyRegistration`, `WarrantyForm`, `warrantySchema`) were intentionally not renamed.

**Shared patterns with PACMS storefront** (`c:\Users\user\Documents\Projects\PACMS\pa-storefront`): Both repos use the same Sentry instrumentation pattern, and the same `report-error.ts` utility structure. When adding cross-cutting features (error handling, auth, caching), check the PACMS storefront for existing patterns to replicate.

**Vercel deployment**: All projects (dck, sg-tools, pa-storefront-ba, pa-storefront-rs) are managed under one Vercel team. Credentials and project IDs are in the PACMS repo at `.claude/skills/prod-vercel/skill.md`.
